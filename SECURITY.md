# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps:

1. Do not create a public issue on GitHub or discuss the vulnerability in public forums.
2. Send an email to support@aircode.io with the following information:
   - A brief description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if possible
   - Your contact information, in case we need to ask for more details
3. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.
4. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure. Any vulnerability reports will be treated confidentially, and we will credit you for your responsible disclosure.
