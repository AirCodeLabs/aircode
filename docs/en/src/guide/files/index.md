# File Storage Overview {#intro}

AirCode provides an extremely simple file storage system, you can just use one line of code to upload files and obtain a CDN-accelerated access address. E.g:

```js
const file = await aircode.files.upload('Hello World', 'hello.txt');
```

At the same time, all uploaded files can be viewed and managed in the `_files` table in the "Database" area, and they can also be uploaded and managed directly from the browser.
