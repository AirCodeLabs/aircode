# Cloud Function Overview {#intro}

Cloud functions are the basic unit of AirCode. With our WebIDE, you don't need to care about the tedious things like infrastructure and environment setup, and online operation.
Just open the webpage and write your Node.js code, then debug it and deploy it as an accessible back-end API. The API can be easily used to provide data to the front-end, valid user, integrate Slack bots and Webhooks, etc.

Cloud functions are built upon serverless, with automatic scaling capabilities, it helps you quickly deal with traffic peaks and save resources.

::: details New to cloud functions?
If you have never developed a cloud function before, it is recommended to follow our [Quick Start](/getting-started/) to learn how to use it.
