# Online Logs {#intro}

Logs can be generated through `console.log` in cloud functions. After the function is deployed, the logs can be viewed in the **Logs** tab, and can be filtered by date and keyword.

## Generate and View Logs {#generate-and-view}

Create a new function, e.g. `log.js`, and modify it as follows:

```js
module.exports = async function(params, context) {
  // Print a log with current time
  console.log('Hello World. Current time is:', new Date());
  // Print a log of Error level
  console.error('This is an error');

  return {
    message: 'Hi, AirCode.',
  };
}
```

Deploy the function online, and click the URL below its name to copy. Open a new page in your browser and visit the URL copied above.

After that, click the **Logs** tab in the right area, and you can see the logs generated by online access in real-time.

::: tip Tips
There may be a few seconds delay in collecting logs, please be patient.

## Log Levels {#levels}

In addition to `console.log`, other methods can be used to generate different levels of logs, it's useful to do filtering when viewing logs.

- `console.info` or `console.debug`: an alias method for `console.log`, which produces a log level of `Info`
- `console.error` or `console.warn`: print the error log, and the generated log level is `Error`

For more usage, see: [Node.js Console API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/console.html).

## Toggle Realtime Fetching {#toggle-realtime-fetching}

By default, AirCode fetches logs in real time and display them in the content area. If you want to turn off real-time fetching, you can click **Pause**, and the logs generated online will no longer be displayed in there.

Click the **Resume** button again to restart the real-time log fetching. The content area will display a starting timestamp, and the logs generated after it will be displayed in there.

## Query Logs {#query}

In addition to viewing real-time logs, you can also query or filter historical logs by dimensions such as date, keyword, or log level.

## Limits {#limits}

In order to ensure the service is running stably, the log bandwidth and storing date will be limited, see: [Resource Limits - Online Log](/about/limits#online-log).
