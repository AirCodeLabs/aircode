# File Storage Introduction {#intro}

It is very easy to upload and manage files in AirCode, which can be done through one line of code in `aircode.files`, and each uploaded file will have a CDN-accelerated access address.

## Objectives {#objectives}

- Learn to use `const file = await aircode.files.upload(content, name?)` to upload files
- Learn to use `const content = await aircode.files.downloadAsBuffer(file)` to download files
- Learn to use `await aircode.files.delete(file)` to delete files

## Use `upload` to Upload Files {#upload}

A file can be uploaded to AirCode by calling the `upload` method. In addition, `upload` can also accept an additional optional `name` parameter, which can be used to specify the file name.

For example, we upload a plain text file:

```js
const aircode = require('aircode');

module.exports = async function (params, context) {
  // Use `aircode.files.upload` to upload a file
  const file = await aircode.files.upload(
    'Hello World',  // The content as string
    'hello.txt'     // Optional. The name of file
  );

  return {
    file
  };
}
```

Click "Debug", then you can see the following results in the "Response" area:

```json
{
  "file": {
    "_id": "636cd5128f59d5369a98664c",
    "name": "hello.txt",
    "url": "https://sample.aircodecdn.com/hello.b10a8db164e07541.txt",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "size": 11,
    "createdAt": "2022-11-10T10:40:18.107Z",
    "updatedAt": "2022-11-10T10:40:18.107Z"
  }
}
```
Indicates that the file is uploaded successfully, and a CDN-accelerated access address is generated. Open the URL directly in your browser to see the file content.

```
https://sample.aircodecdn.com/hello.b10a8db164e07541.txt
```

::: tip Tips
AirCode will generate a unique identifier to each uploaded file. Even if multiple files with the same name are uploaded, the returned URLs will be independent of each other. There is no need to worry about the same name issue.
:::

## View Uploaded Files in Database {#files-table}

Each successfully uploaded file will automatically create a new record in the database's `_files` table. In the "Database" area at the bottom of the console, select the `_files` table to see the file you uploaded.

## Use `download` to Download Files {#download}

::: danger Attention
The `download` API is under development and will be ready in December 2022, stay tuned!
:::

After querying the record in the `_files` table, call the `download` API with the record to download the file content to the local for temporary use. By default, the returned result is of type `Buffer`, which represents the binary information of the file content.

For example, we will find and download the file uploaded in the previous step:

```js
const aircode = require('aircode');

module.exports = async function (params, context) {
  // Use `aircode.db.table` to get the `_files` table
  const FilesTable = aircode.db.table('_files');

  // Use `findOne` to get the file record
  const file = await FilesTable.where({ name: 'hello.txt' }).findOne();

  // Use `aircode.files.download` to download the file, as Buffer
  const content = await aircode.files.download(file);

  return {
    content,
  };
}
```

Click "Debug", then you can see the following results in the "Response" area:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": [ 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100 ]
  }
}
```

::: tip Tips
The downloaded file should only be used temporarily for this request, such as text processing, adding watermarks, etc, and you can upload it to the AirCode file storage through [`upload`](#upload) for persistence after the operation is done.
:::

## Use `delete` to delete files {#delete}

::: danger Attention
The `delete` API is under development and will be ready in December 2022, stay tuned!
:::

Calling `delete` will permanently delete the record from the file storage and the `_files` table, after which the file is no longer accessible via its URL.

For example, we delete the file uploaded in the previous step.

```js
const aircode = require('aircode');

module.exports = async function (params, context) {
  // Use `aircode.db.table` to get the `_files` table
  const FilesTable = aircode.db.table('_files');

  // Use `findOne` to get the file record
  const file = await FilesTable.where({ name: 'hello.txt' }).findOne();

  // Use `aircode.files.delete` to delete the file
  const result = await aircode.files.delete(file);

  return {
    result,
  };
}
```

Click "Debug", then you can see the following results in the "Response" area:

```json
{
  "deletedCount": 1,
  "deleted": [
    {
      "_id": "63637d4807e4d5f7c24b195d",
      "url": "https://sample.aircodecdn.com/hello.b10a8db164e07541.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

Indicates that the file has been successfully deleted. At this point, if you click the refresh button in the "Database" area, you will see that the record in the `_files` table has also been deleted.
