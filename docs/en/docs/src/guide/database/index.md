# Database Overview {#intro}

AirCode provides an out-of-the-box database, which can be accessed and operated directly through `aircode.db` in the cloud function, and there is no need for separated purchase, configuration, and connection steps:

```js
const MyTable = aircode.db.table('myTable');
const item = await MyTable.save({
  name: 'Macbook Air',
  quantities: 25,
});
```

In addition, the underlying layer of the database is Schema Free. This means that you don't need to construct the schema fields in advance, you only need to store the data directly, and AirCode will automatically identify the schema information.

If you have never used a database before, or are unfamiliar with the way of using a database in AirCode, it is recommended to follow [Database Introduction](/getting-started/database.html) to get started quickly.
